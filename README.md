Open-source software for research on neuroeconomy, specifically on decision under risk situations. The simulation is based on the paper by Colin F. Camerer and Martin Weber, The disposition effect in securities trading: an experimental analysis. Journal of Economic Behavior & Organization, vol. 33, 1998. The software was developed as a complement of the mastering in finance research done by Marco Goulart (CNPq scholarship) from Federal University of Santa Catarina. The research was done under supervision of Dr. Newton C. A. da Costa Jr. and the software was developed by Diego Schmaedech and Marco Goulart, software researcher and finance researcher respectively.

The project of developing the ExpEcon software surged of the necessity of a simple and customizable system that could allow us to observe the subjects behavior on investment decision making

The name ExpEcon is an abbreviation of Experimental Economics, economy research line that became strong principally with the economist Vernon Smith. Experimental economics is the application of the laboratory method to test the validity of various economic theories and to test bed new market mechanisms. Using cash-motivated subjects, economic experiments create real-world incentives to help us better understand why markets and other exchange systems work the way they do. Experiments may be conducted in laboratory settings or in the field. The history and methodology of experimental economics was summarized by Vernon Smith (2008):

"Historically, the method and subject matter of economics have presupposed that it was a non-experimental (or 'field observational') science more like astronomy or meteorology than physics or chemistry. Based on general, introspectively 'plausible', assumptions about human preferences, and about the cost and technology based supply response of producers, economists have sought to understand the functioning of economies, using observations generated by economic outcomes realized over time. The data of the astronomer is of this same type, but it would be wrong to conclude that astronomy and economics are methodologically equivalent. There are two important differences between astronomy and economics which help to illuminate some of the methodological problems of economics. First, based upon parallelism (maintained hypothesis that the same physical laws hold everywhere), astronomy draws on all the relevant theory from classical mechanics and particle physics -- theory which has evolved under rigorous laboratory tests. Traditionally, economists have not had an analogous body of tested behavioural principles that have survived controlled experimental tests, and which can be assumed to apply with insignificant error to the microeconomic behaviour that underpins the observable operations of the economy. Analogously, one might have supposed that there would have arisen an important area of common interest between economics and, say, experimental psychology, similar to that between astronomy and physics, but this has only started to develop in recent years."
Two researches are developed based on ExpEcon. The first one is the dissertation presented by Marco Goulart to obtain the Master Degree in Finance on Federal University of Santa Catarina. The dissertation will be The second research, which started as a project to obtain financial support from CNPq (Brazilian National Research Council) is now on evaluation by CNPq coordinators. If the project be approved the CNPq will grant the financial support to buy equipment for measure some subjects biological characteristics (HR, Brain Waves, etc.), which will be done during the ExpEcon experiments.
